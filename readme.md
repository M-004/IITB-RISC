# IITB-RISC
Dear friends,

Here we have a simple implementation of a multi-cycle microprocessor under the guidance of our beloved Professor Virendra Singh. We spent sleepless days and nights working on this project. This project doesn't have any license. So feel free to use it and modify it without giving credits.

Warmest regards,
